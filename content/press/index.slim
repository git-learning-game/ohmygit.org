h2 Description

p <i>Oh My Git!</i> is an open source game that introduces players to the popular version control system "Git". It is highly interactive, and aims at building intuition for operations like "merging" or "rebasing" branches. Players are guided through the features of Git step by step – each level tells a little story where the player can use their new-found powers to solve problems or help others.

p <i>Oh My Git!</i> is available for all major operating systems on <a href="https://blinry.itch.io/oh-my-git">itch.io</a>, and has been downloaded over 2000 times as of February 2021.

h2 Features

p <i>Oh My Git!</i> <b>visualizes the internal structures</b> of Git repositories in realtime. The player can immediately see the results of their actions:

p To accomodate people who are new to Git, the game features a custom-designed <b>playing card interface</b>! The cards help remember newly introduced Git commands, but also contain a short description an an icon. Therefore, they combine both action as well as documentation:

p For more advanced or curious players, the game offers a <b>integrated terminal</b>, where they can execute arbitrary Git commands. There's a "real" Git integrated into the game, which allows players to try and learn all of Git's features.

p To teach players how to use Git for collaboration in teams, <i>Oh My Git!</i> puts a focus on how to <b>interact with remotes</b>, and which workflows exist when dealing with multiple repositories:

h2 Story

p bleeptrack and blinry are frequent collaborators, and have worked on numerous software projects and games together. Seeing that there was no game that allowed people to <b>learn and try Git in-depth</b>, they started working on <i>Oh My Git!</i> in 2020! They applied to the <a href="https://prototypefund.de/">Prototype Fund</a>, an open source funding program of the German Ministry of Education and Research, and were picked among a dozen of other projects to receive funding for six months.

p During this time, they iterated the game a lot from the initial idea to a finished prototype, which was released in February 2021. Following a very playtest-driven approach, they expanded the game to accomodate both people who are completely new to Git, as well as more experienced users. Developing the game as <b>open-source from the start</b> allowed interested people to contribute their ideas, fix bugs, and improve the content.

p After the funding by the Prototype Fund ended in February 2021, bleeptrack and blinry are now <b>looking for new funding sources</b> and partners. They are also always interested in getting feedback to the game, from people who want to learn Git, and from people who might be interested to use it to teach Git to others.

h2 FAQ

b Wait, is this a real Git?

p Yes, <i>Oh My Git!</i> uses real Git repositories for each level. It is important to us that Git beginners have a real-life experience while playing. Also we want to give more experienced Git users all the power they would have when using Git in their productive environment.

b Is there a web version?

p No, currently there is no web version of <i>Oh My Git</i>, because we build upon a real shell and Git. We provide downloadable executables for Linux, Windows and OSX.

b Who is your target audience?

p <i>Oh My Git!</i> focuses on complete beginners. But also more advanced players will learn new helpful tricks about Git, and teachers are able to open prepared repositories in the sandbox mode, to demonstrate certain situations.

b Can people build their own levels?

p
  | Yes, building own levels is super easy. Interested people can find a tutorial in the <i>Oh My Git!</i> repository's
  a< href="https://github.com/git-learning-game/oh-my-git" README.

b What if I want to use Git via the command line?

p You can do both! We integrated the playing cards to give beginners an easier start, but you can also directly type into the terminal. You will even get a badge if you complete a level without playing a card!

b Why are the arrows connecting the commits point in the wrong direction?

p In "Oh My Git" the arrows between commits do not represent the pointers used by Git internally. Instead, the arrows indicate the time direction. We chose this visualization because we found that it confuses Git beginners less.
