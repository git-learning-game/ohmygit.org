h2 Features

p <i>Oh My Git!</i> <b>visualizes the internal structures</b> of Git repositories in realtime. The player can immediately see the results of their actions:

p To accomodate people who are new to Git, the game features a custom-designed <b>playing card interface</b>! The cards help remember newly introduced Git commands, but also contain a short description and an icon. Therefore, they combine both action as well as documentation:

p For more advanced or curious players, the game offers a <b>integrated terminal</b>, where they can execute arbitrary Git commands. There's a "real" Git integrated into the game, which allows players to try and learn all of Git's features.

p To teach players how to use Git for collaboration in teams, <i>Oh My Git!</i> puts a focus on how to <b>interact with remotes</b>, and which workflows exist when dealing with multiple repositories:
